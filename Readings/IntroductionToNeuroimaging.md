# Introduction to Neuroimaging Reading List

A list of resources (in progress!) for understanding how MRI is used for human neuroimaging.

Started by [Isla](https://github.com/islast) in May 2017.

The [nipype-beginner's guide](http://miykael.github.io/nipype-beginner-s-guide/neuroimaging.html) has, for me, been the most helpful thing after Kirstie's megalesson. (Thank you Kirstie :tada: and thank you [Michael](https://github.com/miykael) :sparkles:)

The Neuroimaging [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging) has been helpful.

An [Absolute Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Surface- and Voxel-based Morphometric Analysis](http://cds.ismrm.org/protected/11MProceedings/files/ISMRM2011-8410.pdf) by Doug Greve.

[e-MRI](https://www.imaios.com/en/e-Courses/e-MRI) is an excellent resource for understanding the physics behind MRIs.
