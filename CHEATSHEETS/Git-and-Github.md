### Renaming remotes and branches

Run: `git remote rename oldRemoteName newRemoteName`

Confusingly, to change branch names it is a different syntax.

Use: `git branch -m oldName NewName` where `-m` is for move.

If you're on the branch itself then use `git branch -m NewName`.

Changing branch names is useful if you - as Kirstie often does - put the date in the branch and then don't actually do the work until 2 weeks later! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Once you've renamed the local branch you need to rename it on the remote:

The command `git push origin :OldName NewName` will delete the old branch and push the new one.

Then switch to the new branch (if you aren't already on it) and `git push origin -u NewName` so that this branch tracks the remote one.

### Reset local repository branch to be just like remote repository

*Taken from this [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1628088/reset-local-repository-branch-to-be-just-like-remote-repository-head) and two of the fantastic answers (the accepted answer with [5169 up votes](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1628334) & the one just below with [299 up votes](https://stackoverflow.com/a/27664932)).
Thank you!* :heart_eyes:

Sometimes you just want to get rid of all the local changes and reset a branch to be exactly the same as the one on GitHub (the remote).

This is particularly useful if you have a few different branches going on in your local repository and you don't want to "contaminate" a simple change with the changes in the other branches.

The answer given to the StackOverflow To reset to the same as the `master` branch at your `origin` remote location.

```
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master
```

If you need to remove *untracked files* then you'll need to also run: `git clean -f`.
We recommend running `git clean -n -f` before you do to double check what *will* be deleted without removing the files....just in case!
