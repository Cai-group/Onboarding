# Lab Meetings

(This lab meeting structure has been modified from Kirstie Whitaker's GitHub [Onboarding](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/Onboarding) page)

As the lab grows, the importance of sharing technical skills, domain expertise and tips and tricks for working effectively grows with it.
Lab meetings are a safe space for all members of the group to build communities and trouble shoot.

The meetings are held at the ## on Thursdays at 3pm.
Remote participation will always be available and is strongly encouraged for lab members who are not on campus that day.
The [Cai Lab calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=7nar31c6ni4esif8fn1881kgds%40group.calendar.google.com) shows the times of the meetings.

**Every lab member is expected to participate in the lab meetings.**
This document will talk you through the expectations for participation [before](#preparing-for-lab-meeting), [during](#participation-during-lab-meeting) and [after](#publishing-a-summary-blog-post-after-lab-meeting) lab meeting.

## Participation in lab meeting

### Preparing for lab meeting

Prior to each lab meeting, the chair will send an email to include a title and a brief summary of the meeting content. If feedbacks from the lab members are needed (e.g., workshop a manuscript), create a google doc that allow everyone to comment. This helps keep track of feedbacks.

For attendees, complete the reading (if any), add your comments, and be prepared to discuss.

### Participation during lab meeting

Lab meeting is one hour long.

Bring a computer/tablet and add your thoughts/doubts/ideas to the document during the discussion. Paper and pen will do, too.

### Chairing lab meeting

Everyone is expected to chair lab meeting on a rotating schedule.

Your responsibilities as chair are to:

1. Announce the time, location, and topic of the meeting
2. Plan an agenda. We can discuss research, polish a manuscript/talk, give a workshop, or read a really exciting paper that does not need to be plant related.  
3. Facilitate the conversation during the meeting
  This includes making sure that everyone has a chance to participate, and that everyone complies with the Cai Lab [code of conduct](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/WhitakerLabProjectManagement/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
  
  **Monitoring an effective discussion is a very important skill!**
  Being in charge of managing the time, coordinating everyone's participation and facilitating a productive conversation is a lot of responsibility. Mastering this skill will serve you well in future collaborations and as you advance through your career (inside of academia and beyond).

The first few times that you chair lab meeting, please be in touch with Liming before, during and after that week so she can answer any questions and mentor you though the experience.

### More thoughts on this topic

> *Please add a bullet point with something you'd like the lab members to know about. You may respond to any of the points before or after the lab meeting, no need to wait until the 1 hour time slot! Please add your initials and use the* ðŸ¤« *emoji if you would like the bullet point removed from the GitHub record.*

If five people come to lab meeting, every week for four weeks, and each time they share something interesting, we'll curate 20 content recommendations in just one month.
I'm willing to bet that at least 1 in those 20 will be useful for the lab.
So the first reason to ask people to share some information is to do exactly that: **share knowledge**.

People are often uncomfortable celebrating their successes.
And that is a limitation on the goal of sharing knowledge.
Both [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) and the [Dunningâ€“Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) can stop people from sharing skills and resources that they know.
They may not recognise their strengths, or know how much they don't know and therefore keep quite while others speak much more.
The second goal of sharing something every week is to have **lab members build confidence in their expertise**.
Everyone has something to contribute.

And finally, it feels really good to celebrate others' achievements!
Leaving a little :sparkling_heart:, :raised_hands: or :rocket: emoji, or maybe even a few words of congratulations makes you feel good.
This third goals is to help us all see the progress along a career that is generally rewarded at the end of very long term timescales (a paper takes years to write, and a thesis even more so).
**Stopping once per week to recognise what we've all achieved will help us all along the long research road.**

### Asking questions

> *Please add a bullet point with something you'd like lab members' opinion on. You may respond to any of the points before or after the lab meeting, no need to wait until the 1 hour time slot! Please add your initials and use the* ðŸ¤« *emoji if you would like the bullet point removed from the GitHub record.*

Asking questions is the first step in finding the answers.
If lab members do not ask for help in the first place, then the communities will not be able to support them.
One goal of this section in the lab meeting HackMD is to **unblock lab members so they can move forwards on with their work**.

Responses to a question might be:

* To share a piece of code so they don't need to write it again.
* To share a relevant publication or blog post.
* To share a tutorial that explains how to use a software tool.
* To put the team member in touch with an expert in the field they're investigating.
* To share a similar experience and what went right (or wrong) that time.

Asking questions is also a learned skill.
Analogous to a [Minimal worked example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) it takes time and practice to distill your question from "It doesn't work" or "I don't know what to do" to a specific "I get this error message when I run this command", "I'm stuck on interpreting this figure", "How do I manage this particular challenging community interaction", or "Where should I store my data".
In many cases, it is in creating the question in the first place that you figure out what you need to know.

So the secondary goal of this section is to **help you ask good questions**.

This illustration from her blog post on ["How To Ask Good Questions"](https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/) by [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/) is wonderful.
(The blog post is great too!) 
Just don't let it trick you into thinking that the only good questions are related to technical expertise.
The hardest and most important questions are about **how we plan and design, undertake, and communicate our research** rather than "just" the software tools and datasets they contain.

### Distributed contributions

Many of the projects that Kirstie is involved in are distributed around the world.
Many of us are not co-located and so it is important to find ways to share expertise and build connections and trust from afar.

The HackMD and Zoom links allows lab members to contribute without being physically in the room.

The HackMD also allows lab members to contribute **even if they are not able to join the meeting**.
That way, we can hear updates from them and get answers to our questions, even if our collaborators are not able to join the conversation in real time.

Finally, the HackMD lets **everyone talk at once**.
You can find links and add comments as the conversation in the room is ongoing, which allows parallel participation rather than waiting to speak in a serial timeline :wink:.

## Thank you

I really appreciate your participation in the lab.
We couldn't do the exciting work without you.
