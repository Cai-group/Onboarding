# Welcome to the Cai Lab@UF! 

Whether you're a seasoned researcher or a newcomer to the world of plant biodiversity science, we're thrilled to have you join our team. This repository serves as your guide to the onboarding process to the Cai Lab, designed to provide you with all the necessary resources, information, and guidance to kickstart your journey effectively.

## About Us

Our lab is dedicated to understanding the patterns and processes of angiosperm evolution via the integrative application of fieldwork, wetlab techniques, and biodiversity informatics. We strive to foster an inclusive and collaborative environment where curiosity thrives, and innovative research flourishes.

## Onboarding Process

### I. For everyone
**1. Lab Policies**

Please review our [Core Values](https://github.com/Cai-group/Onboarding/blob/main/CORE_VALUES.md) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Cai-group/Onboarding/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 

**2. Emergency Contact and Laboratory Safety Training**

Safety is our top priority. Please add your emergency contact to this google spreadsheet. Email Liming (cail@ufl.edu) if you need access to the doc.

Familiarize yourself with our lab's safety protocols, including proper handling of hazardous materials, emergency procedures, and personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements. All members should complete the UF lab safety [training](https://www.ehs.ufl.edu/training/) before working in the lab. Get acquainted with the equipment, techniques, and procedures specific to our lab. 

**3. Set up a weekly meeting with Liming**

To better understand mentees' needs and provide tailored support, all lab members are encouraged to schedule a weekly meeting with Liming. Please refer to the [meeting protocol](/Weekly_meeting_w_Liming.md) for more details.

**4. Lab meetings**

Lab meetings are important opportunities for lab members to share technical skills, get feedback, and develop a sense of belonging in the lab. Our lab meetings provide a safe space for anyone to share, improve, and grow. Please refer to the [lab meeting protocol](https://github.com/Cai-group/Onboarding/blob/main/Lab-meetings.md) for more details.
  
**5. Resources and Support**

We're here to support your growth and development as a researcher. Access a wealth of resources, including reference materials, online courses, and mentorship opportunities. The majority of lab-shared resources, such as fieldwork/wetlab/drylab protocols, can be found in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Cai-group/Protocols). Email Liming if you need to be added to the repository. Below are some useful links for all community members.
